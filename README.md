### Object Oriented Programming 

In python does not require you to use objects or classes.Complex programs are hard to keep organized,so,using object oriented approach to organizes and structures code.
Groups together data and behavior into one place, promotes modularization of programs.

- [üèõ    Class](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html)  :
    A blueprint for creating objects of a particular type
    
- [Methods<img align="left" alt="Method Image" width="26px" src="https://refactoring.guru/images/refactoring/content/smells/long-method-01.png" />](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html) : Regular Function that are part of a class.

- [Inheritance](): Means by which a class can inherit capabilities from another.

- [Composition] (): Means of buliding complex objects out of another objects.



` Access Modifier Variable ` &nbsp;
` Access Mofifier Method `

Access modifier means, how we can access our variable and method within scop of class and out sidet the class.
